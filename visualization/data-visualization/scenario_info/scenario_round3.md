</br><h2 style="color:#211e6b">Common Assumptions</h2></br>
<b>- Submission date: </b>March 9, 2021</br> 

 <b>- Baseline date: </b>See specific details below</br> 

 <b>- End date for fitting data: </b>March 6, 2021 - no fitting should be done to data from after this date</br> 

 <b>- Start date for third-round scenarios: </b>March 7, 2021 (week ending March 12) - first date of simulated outcomes</br> 

 <b>- Simulation end date: </b>at least through week ending June 5, 2021 (13-week horizon); preferably Sept 4, 2021 (26-week horizon)</br> 

 <b>- Transmission assumptions: </b>models fit to US state-specific dynamic up until End date for fitting data specified above – no proscribed R<sub>0</sub>, interventions, etc.</br> 

 <b>- Pathogenicity assumptions: </b>no exogenous fluctuations in pathogenicity/transmissibility beyond seasonality effects</br> 

 <b>- Vaccine effectiveness: </b>level of effectiveness and available doses are specified for each scenario; assumptions regarding time required to develop immunity, age-related variation in effectiveness, duration of immunity, and additional effects of the vaccine on transmission are left to the discretion of each team</br> 

 <b>- Vaccine allocation: </b>between-state allocation is based on population per the CDC/NAS <a href=https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25917/framework-for-equitable-allocation-of-covid-19-vaccineresources target="_blank">guidelines</a>  (proportional allocation); within-state allocation and the impact of vaccine hesitancy are left to the discretion of each team</br> 

 <b>- Vaccine immunity delay: </b>There is approximately a 14 day delay according to the Pfizer data; because we suspect the post first dose and post second dose delays may be of similar length, we do not believe there is any need to explicitly model a delay, instead groups can delay vaccine receipt by 14 days to account for it</br> 

 <b>- Vaccine uptake: </b>See specific details below.</br> 

 <b>- Vaccine rollout: </b>rollout to follow <a href=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2020-12/slides-12-20/02-COVID-Dooling.pdf target="_blank">ACIP recommendations</a>  unless known to be contradicted by state recommendations</br> 

 <b>&emsp;- Phase 1a: </b>health care workers, long-term care facilities</br> 

 <b>&emsp;- Phase 1b: </b>frontline essential workers, adults 75+</br> 

 <b>&emsp;- Phase 1c: </b>other essential workers, adults with high-risk conditions, adults 65-74</br> 

 <b>- NPI assumptions: </b>phased reductions of NPIs in 2021 that align with patterns observed at different times in the course of the epidemic in 2020 (see scenario-specific guidance); teams have some liberty on how to implement these reductions within the guidelines</br> 

 <b>- Database tracking of NPIs: </b>teams may use their own data if desired, otherwise we recommend the following sources as a common starting point:</br> 

 <b>&emsp;- </b><a href=https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker target="_blank">Coronavirus Government Response Tracker | Blavatnik School of Government</a> </br> 

 <b>&emsp;- </b><a href=https://www.nga.org/coronavirus-state-actions-all/ target="_blank">Coronavirus State Actions - National Governors Association</a> </br> 

 <b>- Geographic scope: </b>state-level and national projections</br> 

 <b>- Results: </b>some subset of the following</br> 

 <b>&emsp;- </b>Weekly incident deaths</br> 

 <b>&emsp;- </b>Weekly cumulative deaths since start of pandemic (use JHU CSSE for baseline)</br> 

 <b>&emsp;- </b>Weekly incident reported cases</br> 

 <b>&emsp;- </b>Weekly cumulative reported cases since start of pandemic (use JHU CSSE for baseline)</br> 

 <b>&emsp;- </b>Weekly incident hospitalizations</br> 

 <b>&emsp;- </b>Weekly cumulative hospitalizations since simulation start</br> 

 <b>&emsp;- </b>Weeks will follow epi-weeks (Sun-Sat) dated by the last day of the week</br> 

 <b>- “Ground Truth”: </b>The same data sources as the forecast hub will be used to represent “true” cases, deaths and hospitalizations. Specifically, JHU CSSE data for cases and deaths and HHS data for hospitalization.</br> 

 <b>- Metadata: </b>We will require a brief meta-data form, TBD, from all teams.</br> 

 <b>- Uncertainty: </b>aligned with the Forecasting Hub we ask for 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, every 5% to 0.95, 0.975, and 0.99 quantiles</br> 

 <b>- Ensemble Inclusion: </b>at present time, in order to be included in the ensemble models need to provide a full set of quantiles</br>
