"-","Combination of 1) A metapopulation not age-stratified model for a single strain and 2) a state level compartmental model age-stratified and with two strains. The metapopulation county-level SEIR model reproduces transmission within and between the 3142 counties in US. A model-filter framework assimilates daily county incidence of cases and updates the distribution of parameters and state variables at each time step. The inferred parameters and initial conditions are aggregated at the state level and combined with state-level information on population structure, age and state-specific seroprevalence estimates and published age-specific reporting, hospitalization and death rates. Then, to produce age-stratified projections, a second dynamical model, age and population- stratified, is initialized with the previously defined parameters and initial conditions. The age and population-stratified model is a two strains SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) compartmental model run in isolation for each of the 50 US states and DC. Here the population is stratified in 12 groups in order to reproduce different patterns of disease severity and vaccine prioritization. Specifically, in each state, the population is stratified by years of age (0 - 4, 5 - 17, 18 – 49, 50 - 64 and >65), adult exposure status (essential workers, healthcare workers, other adults) and health risk status (presence or absence of one or more health risk factors for severe disease). The model has a spring/summer forcing on Rt (-2% weekly from march 13th for 3 months) and a fall/winter forcing on Rt (+2% weekly from Sept 15th for 3 months). Data inputs: JHU CSSE County-level confirmed cases, Safegraph mobility, CDC SEROPREVALENCE data from Nationwide Commercial Laboratory Seroprevalence Survey (state, age groups), age distribution of recent infections from individual state departments (state, age groups), POLYMOD contact rates across age group in US. The model does not distinguish between natural and vaccine induced immunity and at t0 all susceptible individuals have some pre-existing immunity (either from vaccine or natural infection).

This model incorporates uncertainty in epidemiological parameters and the effectiveness of state-wide intervention policies on social distancing and stay-at-home orders. Infections are seeded stochastically with roughly 10 times the number of confirmed cases in the first five days of a county epidemic and R0 and the duration of the infectious period were drawn stochastically for each county and simulation. Disease follows SEIR dynamics and county commuting data modulates the spread of disease within counties. nStay-at-home orders and subsequent social distancing interventions are updated at the state-level according to recent policy documents. Ongoing interventions continued through the remainder of the simulation period. Intervention effects are inferred where possible.n To model deaths and hospitalizations in the population, we incorporated realistic but fixed time delays from infection to symptom onset to hospitalization to ICU to ventilator use to death and used age-specific demographics to perform a county-level age standardization of health outcome risk. Currently, we assume a 0.5% infection fatality rate and a 3.5:1 ratio of incident hospitalizations to deaths. Infection fatality rates and hospitalization rates are adjusted to account for the age distribution of individuals who have received at least one dose of the vaccine. Weekly adjustments to R0 are made to account for the growing prevalence of the B.1.1.7 variant, which is assumed to be 50% more transmissible and to reach 100% dominance in the US by May.nFor each county, we estimate the seeding time and amount, the baseline reproductive number, the case confirmation to infection ratio, and the effectiveness of interventions (from closing to phased reopenings).

For Omicron, we assume that importations started early in November 2021.","We used an existing agent-based model, FRED (Framework for Reconstructing Epidemic Dynamics) which was developed by the university of Pittsburgh in response to the 2009 influenza pandemic (Grefenstette et al. 2013). We modified the model parameters to represent the natural history of COVID-19 and calibrated a set of parameters to reproduce current trends of deaths due to COVID-19 in the US. FRED simulates the spread of the virus in a population by recreating interactions among people on a daily basis. To accurately represent the population of each of the states simulated, we used a synthetic population of the US that represents demographic and geographic characteristics of the population in 2010 (Wheaton 2012). Each human is modeled as an agent that visits a set of places defined by their activity space. This activity space contains places such as households, schools, workplaces, or neighborhood locations. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur when an infected person visits the same location as a susceptible person on the same day. Numbers of contacts per person are specific to each place type. For instance, school contacts do not depend on the size of the school but the age of the agent. Infected agents have a probability to stay at home if they develop symptoms. Those who do not stay at home continue their daily activities. Public health interventions are included in the model to represent the changes in agentsu2019 behavior in response to an epidemic.In this study, we limited the interventions to school closure and shelter in place. Schools are closed on a specific date to represent state-level guidelines (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray 2020). In the case that schools are closed, students limit their activity space to household or neighborhood locations. Shelter-in-place interventions reduce each agentu2019s activity space to their household at a compliance level from 0-100%, which was estimated as part of the model calibration. Agents who do not comply with the shelter-in-place orders continue with their daily routines. We used state-level orders to determine the date at which people are advised to shelter in place (IHME COVID-19 health service utilization forecasting Team and Murray 2020).See the methods file in our repo for more detailed methods and model limitations.n Updates 2020-05-11 - We updated our likelihood used in our calibration, switching from a Poisson to a negative binomial distribution in order to allow for greater over-dispersion in the distribution of deaths. - We changed the way that we calculate the proportion of the population that is sheltering in place. We no longer use the dates at which government advisories were issued. Instead, we now exclusively use the google mobility data (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) on journeys made to residential locations. We calibrate the maximum compliance to shelter in place, and use a generalized additive model fitted to the google data to forecast movement in the coming 5 weeks. Updates 2021-09-13 - In order to run for the whole of the United States, we calibrate the model to data from Indiana from the start of the pandemic until present. For other states we use infection estimates from CovidEstim (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.17.20133983), a timeseries of the frequency of each variant from https://covariants.org/, and vaccination data to initialize the infection and vaccination histories of the agents in FRED.

However, for this simulation study, we created a smaller synthetic population totalling 375,000 people, with demographics sampled from the entire state population and spatial structure based on Marion County, FL.People in the model vary in behaviors that may result in transmission, and have attributes that may affect infection outcome including age and the presence or absence of comorbidities. We use this synthetic population as an input to a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, detection and reporting. The model assumes a daily cycle of person-to-person interactions that may result in transmission, based on the co-localization of infectious and susceptible individuals in households, workplaces (both as employees and as customers), schools, long-term care facilities, and hospitals.

"cc-by-4.0","Because of the complexity of socio-epidemiological system of COVID-19, we developed a data-driven, non-mechanistic statistical model to track and characterize and predict the cumulative case in 2021, assuming it follow certain asymptotic curves. In round #11 we choose a hybrid method with weighted average of both shorter and longer fitting period in order to capture both short-term and long-term dynamics of COVID-19 especially during the Delta-Omicron transition period, where the asymptomtotic behavior is challenging to track with a simple, single curve. We then projected cumulative case based on the developed model which served as the baseline scenario (no external processes such as changes in NPIs, vaccination campaigns including booster shots, new variant invasion, waning immunity etc.). The difference of daily cumulative case would be the baseline incident case. In order to model various scenarios, we develop the following methodology framework. Vaccination (including booster shots) was modeled as a time-dependent function to reduce incident case using the 2021 data when vaccines are administrated. From round #5/6 we also incoporated age-specific vaccination coverage as well as observed efficacy. Hospitalization was modeled as a binomial process of incident case and no overload of healthcare system was considered in 2021. Hospitalization rate was estimated as a function of vaccination rate (i.e., vaccination not only reduces incident case but also prevents severe disease prognosis that leads to hospitalization and death). We assumed that only severe condition patients required hospitalization (using in-patient data from HHS), and vaccination would reduce the prognosis from non-severe to severe. Similarly, death was modeled as a binomial process of hospitalization (from round #9, death was modeled as a binomial process of incident case with delayed effect), assuming all deaths occurred in hospitalized patients in severe condition. Deaths in long-term care facility or at home were not considered. Death rate was also another function of vaccination rate. To model new variants (Delta and future variants), we assumed a homogeneous initial prevalence (based on assumptions of different scenarios) across all states (though this can be relaxed to reflect more specific state-level variation in prevalence of new variants). We modeled new variants (Omicron) as an exclusively competitive strain, where it would take over the entire COVID-19 strain population by early 2022. Increased transmissibility is then modeled as a time-dependent function of the invasion of the new variant. The maximum increase are modeled either at 1x or 1.66x as directed by the instruction. However, we do include seasonality and potential human behavior into the model as an additional adjustment to increase transmissibility during the first few weeks (late 2021 and early 2022). To incorporate local events such as school opening and winter surge of cases, we use last year's case data to further calibrate local behavior of the model. In addition, during mixture time when the new variant had not taken over the entire host population, increased transmissibility would be modeled as a mixture of current variant (Delta) and the new variant (Omicron). Waning immunity was modeled implicitly as an approximation of immune escape (i.e., waning immunity causes immune escape), an exponential function with respective duration (e.g., 0.5-year or 0.2 year, estimated from current data). We assume the suscpetible pool is still large enough, so increasing incidence was modeled as a function of rate of waning immunity. Loss of protection to hospitalization and death were also modeled as a function of previously immune population percentage (i.e., sum of fully vaccinated and infected but still alive).

"cc-by-4.0 ","We use our agent-based model, called EpiHiper, which computes stochastic transmissions of a disease in a synthetic contact network between individuals and stochastic state transitions within each individual following a disease model. Our disease model is created based on the COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios document prepared by CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/planning-scenarios.html) and is stratified by age group. The disease model is extended to have waning immunity. The immune waning has an exponential distribution with mean of 0.5 year for the time to transition to a partially susceptible state; the age-specific protection on nodes in the partially susceptible state is as specified in the scenario description. Our simulations are initialized with county level data of prior infections (part of which have waned immunity) and recent daily confirmed case counts and state level prior vaccinations (part of which have waned immunity). Prior infections are derived from confirmed cases with different ascertainment rates for different age groups (smaller for children than for adults). We run EpiHiper simulations for each state and combine the output to get results of the whole US. The simulations produce daily infections, hospitalizations, and deaths; and each simulation runs for multiple replicates. We aggregate daily data to get weekly data and compute quantiles for each target from the multiple replicates.modeling_NPI: We have modeled the following NPIs: (i) A fraction of the population chooses to reduce non-essential (shopping, religion, and other) activities. (ii) All K-12 schools are closed from late-December 2021 to the beginning of 2022 and again from mid-June 2022 to late-August 2022; and face masks are used in school while schools are open. (iii) A fraction of symptomatic people choose to self-isolate themselves at home.","UVA-EpiHiper","Jiangzhuo Chen (UVA) <chenj@virginia.edu>, Stefan Hoops (UVA) <shoops@virginia.edu>, Parantapa Bhattacharya (UVA) <parantapa@virginia.edu>, Dustin Machi (UVA) <dm8qs@virginia.edu>, Bryan Lewis (UVA), Madhav Marathe (UVA)","EpiHiper","2021-12-19","UVA Biocomplexity Institute","Not available","Not applicable.",NA,"preschool (0-4 years), students (5-17), adults (18-49), older adults (50-64) and seniors (65+).","35% for naively susceptible people (without immunity), increased for people with immunity (from natural infection and/or vaccination).","For each state, we calibrate the transmissibility parameter in our disease model targeting the state level esimtated effective reproduction number for the last date of fitting data.","age stratified, as suggested in the CDC COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios document but reduced for people with immunity according to the specified protection against symptoms.",NA,"Compliances are 15% on average for (i), 100% for (ii), and 75% for (iii).","estimated from multiple replicates of simulations.","Not applicable.","age stratified, as suggested in the CDC COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios document but reduced for people with immunity according to the specified protection against symptoms.",NA,"recovered (from infections) people go back to a partially immune state after 0.5 years on average.","embedded in our synthetic contact network model.","Not applicable.","as specified in the scenario description.","same as vaccine efficacy against symptoms specified in the scenario description.","as specified in the scenario description, configured per state.","vaccinated people go back to a partially immune state after 0.5 years on average.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
