# Summary of results
Our model results show a peak of cases in mid January 2022 for all scenarios. A slight difference in the peak magnitude was observed in the scenario of higher immunity escape. The results show that the peak of deaths would occur early in February. The scenario with fewer deaths was the scenario of higher immunity escape and optimistic severity of Omicron. In contrast, the scenario of pessimistic severity and higher immunity escape showed the highest number of deaths. 

# Explanation of observed dynamics given model assumptions
The impact of Omicron on the number of deaths is mostly dictated by the assumptions on severity of Omicron, due to the similarity of the magnitude of infections across all the assumptions. 

# Model assumptions
## Initial distribution of susceptibility
Our distribution of susceptibility depends on the historic dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Indiana. We fit the model to data on deaths and circulating variants using data up to January 8, 2022. Based on the calibration results, 40% of individuals had been infected with the wild-type of SARS-CoV-2, 5% with Alpha, and 20% had been infected with Delta. In addition, 55% of the population had been vaccinated with two doses of the vaccine, and around 30% with booster doses. 

## Transmissibility
The scenario of lower transmissibility was determined as the same transmissibility of the Delta variant. Higher transmissibility was defined as 66% more transmissible than Delta. 

## Generation time
We assumed the same generation time of the Delta variant. 

## Waning immunity assumptions
Immunity from natural infection waned at a rate such that after 7 months, 15% of people would be susceptible. Vaccine immunity also waned at a rate defined so that after 1 year, vaccine efficacy against infection from Delta variant would wane to 60% in people under 65 years of age, and 40% in people older than 65. 

## Other updates in model assumptions from previous rounds (e.g., changes in reporting outcomes due to Omicron)
No additional changes were included in the model from round 11.
