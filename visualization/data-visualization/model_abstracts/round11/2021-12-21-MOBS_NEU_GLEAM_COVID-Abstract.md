## Summary

In all scenarios we project a very quick growth of cases, overshadowing any growth we have seen in past waves.  The projected number of infections is likely to overwhelm the testing systems. Projections for deaths are strongly dependent on the specific scenario, ranging from 60% of the delta wave to almost 4 times the January 2021 peak. Hospitalizations numbers ranges from number comparable to the January 2021 peak to a factor 4 to 5 larger in the most pessimistic scenarios. This points out to a likely increased pressure on Hospitals and the health care system. Latest data from the UK and other countries seems to rule out the most pessimistic scenarios and we suggest a cautious approach in reporting those. 

## Methods

We use a multi-scale epidemic model to project scenarios concerning the impact on deaths and hospital admission of the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant in the USA. The model considers a multi-strain structure that has been expanded to account for the ancestral virus and the beta, delta, and omicron variants. We calibrate the model on the full evolution of the pandemic. This will also provide estimates of previously infected people, vaccinated, etc. individuals at the county level in the US. We consider seasonal forcing and, waning immunity for vaccinated and infected individuals. We consider a status quo scenario for the NPIs level and booster uptake informed by the dynamic of the previous vaccination uptake (one and two doses). The severity, and overall protection offered by the vaccines for severe and fatal evolution of the disease to omicron are according to the SMH scenario directions. We do not assume any degradation in the quality of care. 

## Results

We observe a very fast rise of cases with the wave reaching its peak in all scenarios close to mid-January. The peak for hospitalization and deaths is shifted according to the disease natural history delay and the deaths reporting delay. Heterogeneity across states is observed although the general conclusions concerning the fast-growing number of cases and increased pressure on the health care systems are holding across all jurisdictions.  

## Discussion

The scenarios are meant to bound from above and below possible instances of the Omicron surge. Results are consistent on timing and number of cases, however the overall impact on hospitals and deaths is varying considerably according to the severity and vaccines protection to severe disease manifestations estimates. Data gathered recently indicates that scenarios D & C may be overly pessimistic because of the lack of any severity reduction. Scenarios A & B are more aligned with recent evidence but we think that a lower bound to the possible outcome of the Omicronâ€™s surge should consider more optimistic severity reduction and hospitalization protection from fully immunized individuals. 

## Conclusion

Models projects a very rapid surge of Omicron cases with a peak likely in the month of January. Refined scenarios are necessary to provide a more realistic envelope for the impact on the health care systems and the fatality that we will observe in future weeks
